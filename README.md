# Google Place API - API Testing with Rest Assured

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates API testing using **Rest Assured** in **Java**. It focuses on performing key HTTP methods—**GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE**—on the Google Place API, validating responses through assertions on status codes, headers, and payloads. This project is ideal for learning API automation with Rest Assured in a practical, hands-on approach.

## Technologies Used

- **Rest Assured**: A popular Java library for API testing, providing an intuitive syntax for making API requests and validating responses.
- **Java**: The programming language used for writing the test scripts and integrating with Rest Assured for API testing.
- **JSON Schema**: Used to validate the structure of API responses.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following structure for better modularity and maintainability:

```

└── README.md
```

### Folder & File Descriptions

- **Requests/EndToEndApiFlow.java**: Contains the complete API flow with calls for the Google Place API. This file defines all the HTTP requests (**GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE**) and calls the utility functions to handle responses and assertions.
- **Requests/Utils/Payload.java**: Contains payloads used in **POST** and **PUT** requests, stored as Java Strings for easy reference and modification.
- **Requests/Utils/Urls.java**: Defines all the API endpoints and the base URI, making it easy to update endpoints when needed.
- **Requests/Utils/UtilityFunctions.java**: Contains reusable utility functions for sending API requests, making assertions on the responses, and handling common operations like authentication, setting headers, etc.
- **Requests/Utils/response-schema.json**: A **JSON schema** that defines the expected structure of the response from the Google Place API (used for **GET** requests).

## Features & Implementation

### API Testing Flow
The testing workflow involves performing the following key operations:

- **GET**: Fetch details about a place using its place ID.
- **POST**: Add a new place to the Google Places database.
- **PUT**: Update the details of an existing place.
- **DELETE**: Remove a place from the Google Places database.

Each API request is validated with assertions to check:
- **Status Codes**: Ensuring the correct HTTP status codes are returned (e.g., 200 for successful **GET** requests, 201 for **POST** requests).
- **Headers**: Verifying the response headers (e.g., content type).
- **Payloads**: Validating the structure and content of the response body, ensuring it matches the expected data.

### Test Script Example

A sample test script in **EndToEndApiFlow.java**:

```java
public class EndToEndApiFlow {
    @Test
    public void testPlaceDetails() {
        // Example of GET request to fetch place details
        Response response = given()
                            .baseUri(Urls.BASE_URI)
                            .param("placeid", "12345")
                            .when()
                            .get(Urls.GET_PLACE);
        
        // Assert status code
        assertEquals(response.statusCode(), 200);
        
        // Assert response body contains the expected data
        assertTrue(response.getBody().asString().contains("place_name"));
        
        // Validate response schema (using response-schema.json)
        JsonSchemaValidator.validate(response, "response-schema.json");
    }
}
```

### Utility Functions
Utility functions in **UtilityFunctions.java** streamline the testing process by centralizing common tasks:

- **Making API requests**: Functions to send **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** requests.
- **Assertions**: Functions to assert status codes, headers, and response bodies.
- **Schema validation**: Functions for validating response structures against a **JSON schema**.

### Response Validation with JSON Schema
For **GET** requests, the response structure is validated using a **JSON schema** stored in **response-schema.json**. This ensures that the API response adheres to the expected structure.
